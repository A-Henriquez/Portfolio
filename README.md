## Details

### CaliHousingNN

This project demonstrates the process of training a neural network to predict median house values in California based on various features such as average room size and population. Using **scikit-learn** for data handling and **PyTorch** for building the neural network, this project applies simple machine learning concepts to real-world data.

##### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Neural network creation using PyTorch.
- Model training and evaluation.

### IrisNN

This project applies a simple neural network to predict the petal length of Iris-Setosa flowers from the Iris dataset. By using **scikit-learn** for data handling and **PyTorch** for building and training the model, this project showcases how to handle a real-world classification problem using deep learning.

##### Key Features:
- Dataset filtering and splitting.
- Feature scaling to improve neural network performance.
- Training the network and evaluating the results.

### Simple Shell Interpreter

This project is a simple command-line shell implemented in C. It supports foreground and background execution of commands, directory navigation, and background process management. This project focuses on process management and basic file system navigation.

##### Key Features:
- **Foreground and background execution**: Run processes either in the foreground or in the background.
- **Directory navigation**: Change directories and list directory contents.
- **Background process management**: View and manage processes running in the background.

### Train Crossing Simulation

This multithreading project simulates a train crossing system with multiple trains, each having its own loading and crossing times. The dispatcher thread ensures trains cross the track in an orderly manner based on priority. The system demonstrates synchronization techniques in a concurrent environment.

##### Key Features:
- **Multithreading**: Trains operate in their own threads, enabling concurrent loading and crossing.
- **Dispatcher thread**: Manages the train crossing sequence based on priority.
- **Output logging**: Tracks and logs train events during the simulation.

### Disk Image Manager

This project implements a tool for managing a disk image with a custom file system. The tool allows users to inspect the disk structure, list directory contents, and retrieve or insert files into the disk image. It focuses on understanding and manipulating disk structures such as the superblock, FAT, and directory entries.

##### Key Features:
- **Inspect Disk Image**: View basic information about the disk structure (superblock, FAT, and root directory).
- **List Directory Contents**: List files and directories within the disk image.
- **Retrieve and Insert Files**: Retrieve files from and insert new files into the disk image.

### Early 2024

This folder contains a collection of beginner coding projects focused on problem-solving, game development, and GUI applications. These projects allowed me to develop my coding skills and build a solid foundation for more advanced work.

##### Projects Overview:
1. **Sudoku Solver**  
   A Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking and recursion.

2. **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
   An interactive web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing players to play Tic Tac Toe against each other.

3. **Simple Calculator**  
   A Python GUI calculator built with Tkinter for basic arithmetic operations.

## Conclusion

These projects reflect my progress in various areas of software development. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of programming and problem-solving, and together they form a comprehensive portfolio that highlights my growth and ability to tackle real-world challenges.
